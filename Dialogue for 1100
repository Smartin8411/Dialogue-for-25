Dialogue for 1100: So The Story Continues (N Story Series Ep 21)
N: What the, where the hell am I? :-/
Gordon: Well, well, well, if it isn’t N, it has been a very long time, hasn’t it? >:-)
N: GORDON!!! >:-O I should’ve known, :-| It certainly has been long. What happened? You gave up trying to kill me all these years. <:-)
Gordon: Not exactly, :-| But although I’ve been planning something very big. >:-)
N: What is your plan this time? |:-| Honestly, I would’ve thought after 6-7 years, you would’ve given up, because at some point this rivalry has to end. <:-|
Gordon: It hasn’t been that long /:-| has it? <:-(
N: It has dude. <:-\
Gordon: Well then, here I am now. >:-D
N: Where did you even put me at, and what is this place? >:-(
Gordon: Well, remember that message that you saw above months to years back? /:-)
N: Yes, were you the one that wrote that creepy message “BEWARE N, I WILL COME AFTER YOU, IT’S BEEN A LONG TIME”? :-|
Gordon: That’s the one. |:-)
N: The face you had in that message was creepy and ugly as fuck too. /:-|
Gordon: HEY, I work very hard on those structural face reactions. >:-(
N: Well, you can do better. :-( So wait, all this time it was you who made all those weird structural face reactions all those years ago.
Gordon: Yes sir. >;-}
N: It all makes sense now, the Liquor Bar, you intoxicating me, you saying “take him down my assistants” cringey line by the way, and the structural face reactions, it was all you. <:-o
Gordon: WOW N!!!, You are such an amazing puzzle solver, it took you this long to decipher all this. <:-}
N: You are not slick for doing all this to me, >:-( and also, for some reason, you always had the drones try to close in on me like the one in your Liquor Bar, like bro, try a different tactic or give up. >:-{
Gordon: I will never give up, but also I’m tired of you escaping me every time, even my employees can’t get you >:-( like I have so many enemies and employees that can kill you at an instant, but they become useless from time to time. <:-( 
N: Well Gordon, you've got to focus on the quality of your employees, enemies, and your plans rather than the quantity of them. \:-|
Gordon: Maybe you’re right, <:-< or maybe your wrong. >:-p
N: Dude, I’m right. |:-\ Also, you should try not treating your workers like shit, maybe y’all would do better in killing me if thats y’alls fetish all the time. >:-)
Gordon: I DO WHAT I WANT WITH MY EMPLOYEES, AND ALSO IT’S NOT A FETISH! >:-O
N: Seems like it to me, :-} the obsession to kill me is insane, :-/ But anyways, I’m just giving you advice bro, chill out. >:-(
Gordon: Whateves, >:-( but I’m confident that you won’t expect or escape this one }:-}
N: WATCH ME. >;-P (when N gets the first access panel) What the, is this some sort of void? D-:>
Gordon: Good luck hanging on to that HAHAHA. }:-D
N: Dude, you’re not that menacing, |:-( (when N finds something to hang on) but I found something to hang on so HAHAHA to you >:-D
Gordon: You won’t expect this next one that I have in store for you, and ONLY IN STORE FOR YOU.  >;-D
N: You know Gordon, :-) I’ve been studying you for years now, and I was surprised that you didn’t kill me when you intoxicated me at the Liquor Bar, you could’ve killed me right there, but you failed miserably like you always do. <:-}
Gordon: Fuck you N Plus, >:-{ always finding ways to piss me off. >:-O
N: Well, I’m just saying Gordon Godon, you did this to yourself, you are such a disgrace to yourself and your employees. <:-}
Gordon: DAMN YOU N!!! D-:<
N: What, I’m saying the truth, :-| You wonder why, at the end of the day, no one respects you and your decisions. I bet you that some of the people who worked for you got tired of you over the years. <:-)
Gordon: Where are you hearing all of this from? >:-O
N: Don’t worry about it. <:-)
Gordon: (silent anger) >:-( >:-O
N: (when N reaches the exit) Goodbye Gordon, this has been a fun time. :-) But I sadly must go. <:-) Let me know about your next plan that will fail again. >:-O
Gordon: FINE I’M LEAVING, but next time I see you face to face, I WILL DEMOLISH YOU FOR REALS. >:-{
N: (sighs for 1 second and gets annoyed) Stop it Gordon, stop this vendetta, control your anger issues, do some meditation, because at this point, your anger is weak as fuck. <:-|
