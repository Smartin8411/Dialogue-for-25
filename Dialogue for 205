Dialogue for 205: Maze of Suicidial Fun (N Story Series Ep 18)
Bethany: Hey N wanna play a little game. :-) 
N: Oh what the heck sure :-/ let me guess is this your friend Brittany. :-| 
Brittany: Yeah it is what's it to you.  >:-|
N: Are you two lesbos. :-D
Brittany: Hell no, what kind of question is that? >:-( 
N: Relax Brittany it's a joke. >:-| 
Bethany: OK we're getting off-topic here \:-| anyway, the game is that you have to escape this maze my friend and I built while we try to kill you. >:-) 
N: Good luck with that |:-), you two lesbos are not gonna kill me even if you try. >:-D 
Brittany: We are not lesbians >:-( and we'll see bout that motherfucker there are two of us and only one of you. >:-) 
N: Girl I have escaped John and Brick in the tunnels, I'm pretty sure I can escape this fucking maze >:-) which is sort of better than the last one to be honest. \:-| 
Brittany: You have. \:-| 
N: YES I HAVE!. >:-( 
Brittany: Bethany is this true. \:-( 
Bethany: Sadly yeah it's true that was the time N escaped my floorchasers before he got trapped in John and Brick's tunnels in which I will also say its my tunnel because John, Brick and I concocted the whole plan about trapping N in the tunnels and shit. <:-|
N: Yeah, that plan also failed just like your last maze structure and this plan will also fail because I'm an adept player. \:-) 
Bethany: You can't guarantee that N, if this plan doesn't work, then all of the people that were involved in Gordon's plan will take you down instantly, along with our enemies and traps. \:-) 
N: OK, lets see what happens to me only God and the future knows what happens to me. |:-) 
Bethany: Yeah that's true. \:-| 
N: There was this one time that I saw Gordon and he swore to God that if he did not kill me in his whole life than he would be in hell forever which is not a smart decision to say for his fate. \:-| 
Brittany: Why in the world would he say that. \:-| 
Bethany: Maybe because he thinks that N would be an easy person to kill which I kind of disagree because he has escaped us many times. <:-| 
N: Yeah I have I am one of the best platformers in the world I can escape anything anytime. >:-) 
Bethany: I can't believe I'm saying this, but yeah, you are one of the best platformers in the world and there is almost nothing we can do to stop you, but although it is still possible to kill you. \:-| 
N: Finally, you get it and thanks for the agreement and it is possible to kill me <:-) but your not gonna kill me even if you try. >:-) 
Bethany: We'll eventually see about that. >:-) 
N: OK one more thing, do I have to collect the gold. :-| 
Bethany: No, you don't have to, only if you want to prove that I think you're the best platformer in the world and want money. >:-) 
N: But I'm one of the best platformers in the world. >:-) 
Bethany: One of the best platformers but not the best platformer in the world. >:-) 
Brittany: Ok we've been chatting for too long lets just kill this turd. >:-| 
Bethany: Oh right <:-o get ready to die N. >:-) 
N: Good luck killing me you two. \:-) 
Bethany: Oh we will. |:-) 
Brittany: Yeah what she said. \:-| (moments later when N reaches the exit) 
N: Yes I have finally escaped this fucking maze <:-D but better than the last one sort of. \:-| Bethany: I am getting so fucking tired of how we can't execute this platformer were you even trying to aim for N Brittany. >:-| 
Brittany: Yes, I was Bethany were you trying to aim for N. >:-| 
Bethany: Uh, yeah, I was (N interrupts Bethany and Brittany) 
N: Girls, you both tried to aim at me instantly, and you both failed, just accept it. >:-| 
Brittany: Whatever N, just get out of here. >:-| 
Bethany: Yeah, get out, we'll come back for you at no time >:-| 
N: OOOOOOK good luck with that. <:-\ 
Bethany: Oh we will N we will. >:-) 
Brittany: Yeah, what she said. \:-|
