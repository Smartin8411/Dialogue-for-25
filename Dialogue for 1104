N: Oh great, another room. |-| Is this the store that Gordon had for me? ):-|
Gordon: YES IT IS N! >:-)
N: What with your 4 drones, mines, and thwumps? |-|
Gordon: It is whatever you see N. >:-)
N: Oh great, and it's the whole crew again. |-| WILL YOU GUYS JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!! >:-(
Bethany: But N, we miss you, it's been a long time, at least since you escaped our last room. <:-(
Brittany: I certainly can't say that I miss him, even in his death. :-|
N: You do Bethany? \:-(
Bethany: Yes, its been years. :-(
N: You miss me to kill me. :-|
Bethany: EXACTLY!!! >:-)
N: Sure whatever, I'm dead this time. <:-)
John: Yes, Packard Bastard. |:-)
N: Shut the fuck up Joe Hoe, you're honestly the most annoying out of all Gordon's crew. >:-(
Brick: Damn :-/
John: Me annoying please, look at you always pissing Gordon off and escaping us everytime, if I were to say whos the most annoying, it is YOU. |:-(
N: But, I'm not part of Gordon's crew, :-| I'm a target, \:-( so make it make sense, stupid. >:-(
John: But I was not talking about you being in Gordon's crew, I'm saying you're the most annoying generally, not me. >:-(
N: (talks quietly) This nigga >|-(
N: Whatever bro, I'm not gonna try to be defensive with that statement and deflect back, because the argument of annoyance over and over is so childish. >:-|
John: Good, keep it that way loser. >:-(
N: How am I a loser if I keep escaping you guys, technically I'm the winner, you're the loser. |:-)
John: Whatever Packard. >:-(
N: Also, I see you still indulging in those cigarettes, huh. |:->
John: Yeah, it gets the job done. :-)
N: Does it really? /:-(
John: Yes, it does, what's it to you? >:-(
N: Just saying, you should quit that shit men, /:-/ you'll be easier to kill the more you smoke those things. |:-)
John: Yeah, okay, buddy.
Bethany: Yeah dude, N is right, you should quit that shit. /:-(
Brittany: Same, and I'm the one with the anger issues, agreeing with N as well. |:-\
Gordon: Me 3. :-|
John: All y'all siding with N, we're supposed to be casting him out, now I feel casted out. :-( What about you Brick? <:-(
Brick: I got nothing to say. :-\
N: See John, even your colleagues agree with me. |:-)
John: Whatever Packard, I won't stop, and you can't make me. |:-|
N: Your funeral. <:->
Brittany: This is taking too long, can we please kill N, so I can go home? >:-(
N: WOW BRITTANY, losing your patience already, <:-/ I see, well I don't know about you, but I'm enjoying this conversation. (:-)
Brittany: You don't want to mess with me, N. >:-(
N: You already messed yourself up with that hairdue. |:-D
Brittany: Fuck you N. >:-(
N: Your severe anger issues taking over huh, :-/ I literally told Gordon this last time, do some meditation. :-)
Brittany: >:-(
N: Anyways Gordon, what is all of this? >:-/
Gordon: Well N, as John says, it seems that this time, my assistants will be casting you out. >:-)
Bethany: Yeah take him down assistants. >:-)
John: Yeah take down the Packard. >:-)
N: Ok, so y'all not fighting me on your own, y'alls just gonna use your assistants as your slaves to kill me, got it. <:-)
Gordon: Boy, I can beat you myself. /:-|
Brittany: Yeah same. >:-(
N: Ok, if you say so, do it, and watch me beat this in like 10-20 seconds. |-(
Gordon: Take him down slaves, you don't got much ground N, so watch where you fall. >:-D
N: Ok door do you're thing, damn that chaingundrone almost got me (when N reaches the exit) Done!!!, now y'all casted out.
Brittany: Ok Gordon, can I go home now, this whole scheme is very tiring and pathetic. >:-(
Bethany: Brit, calm down, I'm sure we will get N one day. <:-(
Brittany: NO!!!, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTIME WE TRY TO GET THE N WORD, IT FAILS, AND WE WERE LITERALLY HERE DOING NOTHING, BUT WATCHING N GET TAKEN DOWN THE WHOLE TIME BY OUR ASSISTANTS, LIKE I GOT THINGS TO DO AT HOME. >:-(
Bethany: I know Brit, <:-( but have faith girl, we'll get N one day. <:-)
Gordon: YEAH HAVE FAITH BRIT, and also you go home when I say we go home, as your boss, you do as I say, and that goes for all of you. >:-(
Brick: Damn bro. :-(
Brittany: AND IF I DON'T. D-:<
Gordon: Then I'll kill you, you pretty much know the NDA for working for me, including the secrets and plans that it takes to kill N. >:-(
Brittany: DO IT THEN KILL ME, but I just don't understand why you would not just fire me instead of killing me. >:-(
Bethany: Brittany, no. <:-(
Brittany: Shutup Beth, >:-( I don't mean to say that to you, but as a sister, just stay out of this. <:-(
Bethany: Look Brit, I'm saying don't argue with Gordon to protect you. <:-(
Gordon: Yes Brit, listen to Bethany. >:-( Also, the reason I don't fire people is that once I hire people, they work for me for life, until they complete their task, such as killing N. If I fire you, then I'll have to kill you because you know my secrets and you can expose that to N. >:-( Not saying you will, but you never know. :-|
Brittany: Be so for real boss, |:-( you think I would expose secrets to N? Dude is not even my friend. >:-(
Gordon: I don't care if he is or not, you work for me period, I'm not taking chances. >:-(
Brittany: So you basically have trust issues? >:-(
Gordon: Don't test me Brit. >:-(
Brittany: Don't call me Brit. >:-(
Bethany: Brittany, STOP!!! D-:>
John: Yeah Brittany stop. Gordon is as powerful as you think he is. Ok, maybe we fail but, we will get him.
Bethany: Please stop arguing with Gordon for me, please :-(
Brittany: That's what we all say everytime, but whatever, I'm leaving. |:-(
Gordon: You don't leave until I say we leave. >:-(
Brittany: GORDON, N IS GONE, also why isn't Kevin in on this plan too, dude has been ditching us for the longest time, you said the next time that if Kevin did not join, that you would kill him. >:-(
Bethany: But Brit, you know Kevin's leg has been broken for the longest time. |:-|
Brittany: I know and I feel bad, <:-( but I have to be honest, it has been years now and it seems like Gordon is not keeping to his word.  >:-(
John: Well guys, I'mma go smoke some more ciggys, I shall see y'all next time. :-|
Brick: Yeah same, I'm out, let us stop the arguing please. <:-(
Gordon: No one is going anywhere, also Bethany, can you go to Kevin's house and tell him to come to my Liquor Bar, or report to me by tomorrow, or else, he dies, because his leg should of been healed by now, and he has not called me to tell me that he will be returning. I feel like he's avoiding me at all costs, and I am getting very tired of waiting for him. >:-{
Bethany: It is strange that he has not been showing up. /:-| But yes boss, I will tell him. <:-|
Gordon: Thank you. :-| Now go on. <:-) Now the rest of you, you shall come with me to the Liquor Bar to plan our next meeting. :-|
Brittany: OH MY GOD!!! |:-{
Brick: Brittany, let's just go with him and get this out of the way. <:-/
John: Same, I want to smoke some ciggys and plan our next scheme to take down the Packard Bastard. |:-(
Brittany: Whatever, can I just go with Bethany to talk to Kevin. |:-|
Gordon: NO!!! Brittany, I don't know what has been going on with you today, you are coming with me, John, and Brick to the bar, whether you like it or not. >:-(
Brittany: Whatever boss. >|-|
Bethany: Just go with him, <:-| I'll be back soon for us to hang. <:-)
Gordon: This goes for all of you, I will not tolerate disobedience around here, y'all will not cast me out because of the amount of orders I give you, the pay, whatever. These rules have been enforced since y'all have started working for me, and y'all are gonna stick strictly by them. >:-(
John: But boss, you hardly pay us at all. |:-|
Brittany: Yeah, what John said. >:-|
Gordon: John, I don't want to hear it. |:-| Guys, we will discuss all this later. |:-( Now Bethany, go to Kevin now and meet us later. :-|
Bethany: Ok boss, I'm leaving, bye y'alls. :-)
