Gordon: Ok guys you all here. :-) 
Bethany: So far yeah boss but Kevin couldn't make it. :-| 
Gordon: Where is Kevin. >:-| 
Bethany: He said that his leg is broken, so he had to rest it a bit and then he told me that he'll come either later or tomorrow. <:-| 
Gordon: But we have to kill N now when he arrives here. >:-| 
Bethany: Let's just do this without him. <:-| 
John: Yeah I'm with Bethany on this one let's kill the Packard Bastard once and for all without Kevin being here. >:-) 
Gordon: Fine, but as soon as we all combine our strengths to execute N then we don't have to worry about bringing Kevin along but if we don't kill N then the next time Kevin does not come for this then we will have to kill him. >:-|
Bethany: Even if he's sick. <:-| 
Gordon: YES!. >:-| 
Brittany: But Gordon, how is that fair it will only be fair if Kevin does not want to obey your orders. \:-| 
Brick: Yeah boss, what about if you were Kevin would you want that to happen to you? \:-| 
Gordon: Do you think he's trying to stall. >:-| 
Brittany: I don't think so. \:-| 
Gordon: Well, if he stalls not wanting to kill N, then he will die. >:-( 
Brick: You didn't answer my question boss. \:-( 
Gordon: I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER YOUR FUCKING QUESTION BRICK NOW C'MON GUYS LETS FOCUS AND TAKE DOWN N ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!. >:-| 
N: Yeah well good luck with that guys you can't take me down because I won't let you take me down, you 5 are very pathetic you never listen and you waste your lives attempting to kill me even if that means that your lives will be wasted by me, it doesn't have to be like this just give up and you will all be spared and we can all be friends it's simple as that. <:-|

Gordon: That's it take him down guys. >:-| 
John: Yeah lets finish this Packard Bastard. >:-) 
Gordon: John, why do you call N "Packard Bastard". |:-|

Gordon: But his name is N not Packard. |:-| 
John: It doesn't matter boss, he called me Joe Hoe before. >:-| 
N: At least Joe is close to your name John >:-|, Packard is not even close to my name N. >:-| 
John: Whatever, lets just change the subject and kill you. >:-( 
N: You know what I am very tired of justifying myself to you guys that you won't be able to kill me, so I'm just gonna say nothing there >:|.
