Dialogue for 131: Chase Him (N Story Series Ep 8)
N: What am I doing here? 
Bethany: Hello N do you know why you're here. 
N: Let me guess to send your floorchasers to come after me. 
Bethany: How do you know. <:-| 
N: Because Kevin told me you were going to send floorchasers to chase me after last time I escaped your drone. 
Bethany: Wait Kevin told you how. 
N: We met at the Parkour Race along with his friend Leo.
Bethany: Interesting, who's Leo? 
N: Not relevant to what we are talking about, just let me go >:-|

Bethany: How could I have a crush on someone that I don't know >:-| 
N: I'm just guessing anyway this conversation has been going on for too long can you let me go now. >:-(
