Dialogue for 189: Eavesdropping On A Slight Conversation (N Story Series Ep 15)
Gordon: Ok, you guys all here? 
Bethany: Yeah boss, we're all here, so what do you need? 
Gordon: So all this time we have tried everything to stop and kill N, but he keeps escaping us, our traps, and enemies, and nothing's working. 
N: (talks quietly) What's going on up there, I heard boss, could Gordon be behind this, could they have a meeting about killing me, let's eavesdrop and find out. 
Gordon: Does anyone have any ideas of how to get rid of N once and for all? 
Bethany: How about we lure N to a trap using trapdoors and kill him fast before he escapes. 
Gordon: That won't really work, N can overcome almost every obstacle anytime, anyone else. 
John: Oh, how about we combine our strengths and use them against that Packard Bastard so that way he will have a very difficult time escaping us, the obstacles and enemies and we can kill him instantly. 
Gordon: Yes John that's brilliant, so the next time all 4 of us see N we can sneak up on him and take him down instantly good plan John. 
John: Thanks boss. 
Brick: Yeah good plan friend. 
John: Thanks. 
N: (talks quietly) You guys are not going to kill me, even if it means combining your strengths so I would not be trying anything if I were you guys.
Gordon: Ok guys let's go where's Kevin. 
Bethany: Kevin broke his leg skateboarding. 
Gordon: That motherfucker okay well someone's gonna have to tell him about the plan. 
Bethany: I'll do it. 
Gordon: Ok good thanks Bethany ok lets go. 
Bethany: No problem Gordon. 
N: (talks quietly) Shit I need to prepare myself for anything that comes my way.
