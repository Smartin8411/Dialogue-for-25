Bethany: Hello N you are going to die soon of what we got planned for you. >:-) 
N: Yeah right of John's shitty plan about you, him, Brick and Gordon of combining your strengths to try to kill me instantly well guess what you guys are not gonna kill me even if you try. >:-D 
Bethany: How do you know about that \:-|. 
N: I'll tell you later when your gang gets here anyway why am I here. \:-| 
Bethany: Well N you're here because remember the time you escaped my seeker drone in my Mine Field Palace and remember the time when you escaped my floorchasers before you got trapped in the tunnels. 
N: Oh yeah, I remember your enemies were trash. >:-D 
Bethany: I would not go there nigger >:-| anyway lets see if you can escape my thwumps in my maze well I would not say maze more like a puzzle well not like a puzzle you know what forget it. 
N: Fuck you just get to the point. >:-| 
Bethany: Well, I'll guarantee that my thwumps will be a lot faster than you and instantly crush you to your death. 
N: OK Bethany, your right, I am gonna die from your thwumps and there is no way to escape. <:-| 
Bethany: You really think that N. \:-| 
N: Of course not bitch I'm being sarcastic thwumps are fucking useless they just go straight when they charge at you and your maze will be easy for me to escape since I'm an adept player. >:-)

N: Oh Bethany, sweet sweet Bethany, you will never learn or listen that I am very challenging player for you and your folks to kill me. >:-)

Bethany: I don't know Gordon wouldn't even tell us you should ask him what you did to him. >:-| 
N: Ok, next time I see him I'm gonna ask him why he hates me and hired you fools to assassinate me. <:-( 
Bethany: Yeah you do that anyway >:-) enough talking let the thwumps thwump you to your death. >:-(
